## Installation

There is no installation needed as this is a web application.

## Usage

The purpose of this application is to show how I can use HTML, CSS, JS and etc. This is an application where you can see the weather for five days. I wasn't able to get the 5-day forecast working without going through a couple of tutorials. And they still don't work
